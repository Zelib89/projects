      <h2>INTRODUCTION<sup><small>Chapter 1</small></sup></h2>
      <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup<br> 
        instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the<br> 
        documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

        <h2>CORE COMPONENT<sup><small>Chapter 2</small></sup></h2>
        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and<br>
        the app platform's native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform's<br>
        APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <i>bundles<br>
        reusable, nestable code.</i>You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let's cover<br>
        ow components work in React Native.

        <h2>REACT FUNDAMENTALS<sup><small>chapter 3</small></sup></h2>
        <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br> JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br> you started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p>We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<mark>&lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat!&lt;Text&gt;.</mark></p>
        <p>The React docs have a <u>comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark>
        </p>
        <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
        <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component's personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

        <h2>HANDLING TEXT INPUT<sup><small>Chapter 4</small></sup></h2>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
